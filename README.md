# Dynasty Baseball Team Manager

A comprehensive Streamlit web application for managing your Fantrax Dynasty Baseball Team with advanced dual-value analysis.

## Overview

This application helps you make better dynasty baseball decisions by tracking both:

1. **League Scoring Value** (The "Results") - How players perform in your specific fantasy scoring system

### Pitching

- **K** - Strikeouts
- **ERA** - Earned Run Average

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Ensure you have the PLAYERIDMAP.csv in the data/ folder**

## Usage

### Start the application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### First Steps:

1. **Load Data** - Click "Load Steamer Projections" on the Dashboard
2. **Search Players** - Use Player Lookup to find specific players
3. **Analysis** - Navigate to Value Analysis to find buy-low/sell-high candidates
4. **Compare** - Use Player Comparison to evaluate trade offers

## Data Sources

- **Player ID Mapping**: SFBB Player ID Map (PLAYERIDMAP.csv)
- **Projections**: Steamer projections via pybaseball
- **Advanced Stats**: Statcast data via pybaseball
- **Roster Data**: Manual Fantrax CSV export (Fantrax API not available)

## Dual-Value Analysis Logic

The evaluator analyzes players on two dimensions:

1. **Fantasy Score**: Calculated from league scoring categories
2. **Peripheral Score**: Calculated from process metrics

Players are flagged as:

- **💎 Underperforming**: Strong peripherals, weak fantasy output (BUY)
- **⚠️ Overperforming**: Strong fantasy output, weak peripherals (SELL)
- **Aligned**: Fantasy output matches peripheral quality
- **Confidence Rating**: 0-1 scale based on sample size and metric alignment

## Key Functions

### data_manager.py

- `DataManager.load_id_map()` - Load player ID database
- `DataManager.fetch_steamer_projections()` - Get Steamer projections
- `DataManager.fetch_statcast_data()` - Get Statcast metrics
- `DataManager.get_ids_by_fantrax()` - Map Fantrax ID to other IDs

### evaluator.py

- `PlayerEvaluator.evaluate_batter()` - Evaluate a batter's dual value
- `PlayerEvaluator.evaluate_pitcher()` - Evaluate a pitcher's dual value
- `PlayerEvaluator.identify_buy_low_candidates()` - Find undervalued players
- `PlayerEvaluator.identify_sell_high_candidates()` - Find overvalued players
- `compare_players()` - Compare two players side-by-side

## Customization

You can customize the scoring weights in [evaluator.py](evaluator.py):

```python
self.batter_scoring_weights = {
    'R': 1.0,
    'RBI': 1.0,
    'OBP': 100.0,
    'SBN2': 2.0,
    'XBS': 1.5
}
```

Adjust these values to match your league's specific point values.

## Fantrax Integration

✅ **Full Fantrax API integration is now available!** Using the `fantraxapi` library, you can:

- Pull your live roster directly from Fantrax
- View league standings in real-time
- Track recent transactions
- Analyze all teams in your league

### Quick Setup for Public Leagues

1. Install: `pip install fantraxapi`
2. Get your League ID from your Fantrax URL
3. Connect in the app's "🔗 Fantrax League" page

### Setup for Private Leagues

If your league is private, run this one-time setup:

```bash
python setup_private_league.py
```

This will authenticate you with Fantrax and save your credentials for automatic login.

**See [AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md](AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md) and [FANTRAX_GUIDE.md](FANTRAX_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.**

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Historical trend analysis
- [ ] Trade calculator with multiple players
- [ ] Draft assistant mode
- [ ] Injury tracking integration
- [ ] Custom scoring system builder
- [ ] Free agent analysis from Fantrax
- [ ] Automated waiver wire recommendations

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit 1.28+
- pandas 2.0+
- pybaseball 2.2.7+
- fantraxapi 1.0.0+ (for Fantrax integration)
- selenium + webdriver-manager (for private league authentication)
- Internet connection for data fetching

## Notes

- **Steamer projections**: Available year-round for next season
- **Statcast data**: Only available during/after the season starts
- **Data caching**: pybaseball automatically caches data locally
- **Performance**: Limited to 100 players for analysis operations to maintain speed

## Troubleshooting

### "pybaseball not available" error

```bash
pip install pybaseball
```

### "PLAYERIDMAP.csv not found"

- Ensure the CSV is in the `data/` folder
- Check the file path in data_manager.py

### Statcast data returns empty

- This is normal during off-season
- Statcast data starts accumulating once the season begins
